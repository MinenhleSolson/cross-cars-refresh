# React.js Cross Cars2(refresh)

<br>

## Summary

This is A car sale website it a refresh of the previous website I built Long ago, I wanted to change the Look of it and also switch the codebase from jQuery and bootstrap to React.js. The first cross cars website was one of the first projects I built so in the refreshed website I wanted to apply all the skills I have learnt along my journey of being a software developer and by that, I made the website more user friendly.
