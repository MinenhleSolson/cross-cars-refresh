<br>

## Summary

This is A car sale  website it a refresh of the previous website I built Long ago, I wanted to change the Look of it and also switch the code base from jQuery and bootstrap to React.js. The first cross cars website was one of the first project i built so in the refresh website i wanted to apply all the skills I have learnt along my journey of being a software developer and by that I made the website more user friendly.
