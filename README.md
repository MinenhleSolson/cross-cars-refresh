<br>

## Summary

This is A car sale website it is a refresh of the previous website I built Long ago, I wanted to change its Look of it and also switch the codebase from jQuery and Bootstrap to React.js. The first cross cars website was one of the first projects I built so in the refreshed website I wanted to apply all the skills I have learned along my journey as a software developer and by that, I made the website more user-friendly.
